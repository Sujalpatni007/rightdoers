The system runs in SIMULATION MODE - Twilio is NOT configured, so messages are logged but not actually sent. For production, TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, and TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER need to be configured in backend/.env. Backend APIs at /api/whatsapp/* all working. Frontend at /whatsapp, /whatsapp-signing, /nda-signing routes. MongoDB collections: whatsapp_signings, whatsapp_approvals, legal_documents."
