**original_problem_statement:**
The user, acting as Captain Right Doers Architect, is building HI AI-APP.COM, a **Human Potential Management and Transformation Company (H.P.M.T.C.)**. The vision is a multi-lingual, gamified Progressive Web App (PWA) that functions as a comprehensive career and life transformation platform, described by the user as a WOW APP and a Super App.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Core Philosophy:** The app is described as an AGENTIC AI for Dreamers • Doers • Disrupters • Deep Humans. It's built on a Glocal Gurukul concept, combining Indian mythology (Trinity, Pandavas), Ayurvedic principles (Prakruti), and modern business strategies (Amazon's scale, Neil Patel's G.E.O). The goal is to become the NPCI for Human Capital.
2.  **Core Hook:** A landing page that asks, **Will AI take away my jobs OR make my life better?** presented via a simple card-picker.
3.  **Entry Points (The Cosmic Flywheel):** A rotating flywheel on the landing page representing the 5 'P's: 🎓 Pupil, 👥 People, 🤝 Partners, ⭐ Performers, and 🆔 Profiles.
4.  **Flagship Features:**
    *   **Doers Profiler (D.P.):** A data-driven user profile, now conceptualized as a Talent Card with a verifiable DoersScore™ (like a CIBIL score for talent).
    *   **Talent Tracker:** A module within the D.P. to track skill development and calculate an Efficiency Value, showing that skills can overcome a lack of natural personality fit.
    *   **Agent AIMEE:** A central AI agent that guides users based on their choices.
    *   **Viral Share Campaign:** A feature to Send Your Profiler, designed to create a Facebook moment for talent sharing.
    *   **Captain Command Centre:** A founder's dashboard featuring a **5C Decision Making Framework** (Connections, Campaigns, Communications, Content, Currency).
    *   **DOERS ONE Family Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard for families, tracking the individual goals of each member with multi-lingual support.
5.  **Business & Vision:** A B2C/B2B SaaS model aiming for a presentation at the **World Expo 2031**. The architecture should be optimized for Agent to Agent (A2A) discovery, following G.E.O (Search Everywhere Optimization) principles.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a visually rich PWA with an expansive frontend. A significant refactor just occurred, moving the backend from being 100% mocked to having a foundational persistence layer using FastAPI and MongoDB.

*   **Frontend:** The UI is highly developed with many new components and pages created this session, including  and . The landing page has been redesigned multiple times, now featuring a Cosmic Flywheel for navigation.
*   **Backend:** A new structured backend has been created with  (defining Pydantic models for Users, Profilers, Families, etc.) and  (containing FastAPI endpoints for CRUD operations).  now acts as a router. The backend is connected to a real MongoDB instance.
*   **Integration:** The frontend is **NOT YET CONNECTED** to the new backend APIs. It still uses hardcoded mock data for all displays.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: Building the **backend persistence layer**. This involved creating  with all necessary Pydantic models,  with FastAPI endpoints for CRUD operations, and refactoring  to use these new routes.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: Y (The agent tested the new backend APIs with  and successfully ran the , which passed all tests for the backend logic.)
- Which testing method agent to use? The user has stated their CTO and Data Scientist will test the build. The next agent's first task is to connect the frontend to the backend, after which a full E2E test using the  is required.
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: CRITICAL - Frontend-Backend Integration (P0)**
  - Description: The entire frontend is still operating on static, hardcoded data. It needs to be connected to the newly created backend APIs to provide any real functionality. This is the highest priority task to make the app launchable for testing.
  - Status: NOT STARTED

- **Issue 2: Hardcoded Test Data in Backend (P2)**
  - Description: The previous version of  contained hardcoded logic (e.g., phone number  defining an employer). This needs to be verified as removed during the recent backend refactor.
  - Status: NOT STARTED

- **Issue 3: Missing  attributes (P2)**
  - Description: Many components still lack  attributes, which will hinder robust automated frontend testing.
  - Status: NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **P0: PDF Report Generation:** Implement a Big 5 Report downloadable PDF from the  page. The user wants this to be a key part of the viral sharing loop, like Spotify Wrapped for careers.
    *   **P1: Build DOERS STUDIO Page:** Create a page to feature expert podcasts, starting with J Chaudhary, based on the user's uploaded  artifact.
    *   **P1: Implement Flywheel Feel UX:** The user wants the rotating cosmic feel of the landing page's entry points to be a consistent UX pattern across the app to signify progress and motion.
    *   **P1: Implement Content Ecosystem Workflow:** Build the UI/workflow for the Neil Patel-inspired  content strategy.
    *   **P1: Implement Real Authentication & Payments:** Replace mocked OTP with a real service and integrate Razorpay for payments.

- **Future Tasks:**
    *   **P2: Integrate Real AI:** Connect Agent AIMEE and other components to a real LLM (user mentioned Google DeepMind).
    *   **P2: Build Jobs4Me Matcher (L1-L5):** Develop the job matching platform.
    *   **P2: Daily Career Capsules & Streak System:** Implement gamified learning modules with a daily streak counter and D-COIN rewards.
    *   **P3: Build out Robo Helper** as the third part of the Right Doers Trinity.
    *   **P3: Blockchain-based Digital Profile.**

**Completed work in this session**
- **Doers Profiler (D.P.):** Created , a new page for the Talent Card concept, featuring the DoersScore™, Talent Tracker module, and Efficiency Value calculation.
- **Viral Share Feature:** Implemented a sophisticated share modal on the Doers Profiler page with a custom campaign message (From Fake Display Pictures to Real Talent Card).
- **Captain Command Centre:** Renamed the Founder Dashboard and added the **5C Decision Making Dashboard**, inspired by Neil Patel's G.E.O. principles.
- **DOERS ONE Family Dashboard:** Created , a multi-lingual (Kannada/English) dashboard for tracking a family's collective and individual goals.
- **Landing Page Redesign:** Iterated through multiple designs, culminating in the WOW APP version. It features a card-picker for the initial question and a Cosmic Flywheel for the 5 entry points, with Agent AIMEE at the center.
- **Splash Screen Update:** Redesigned the splash screen to feature a specific SVG asset flow as requested by the user.
- **Backend Persistence Layer:** Major refactor of the backend. Created  with Pydantic schemas and  with a full suite of FastAPI endpoints for Users, Profilers, and Families, successfully moving away from a mocked backend.

-   **Issue 1:  attributes missing.**
    -   Debug checklist: Review all new and existing pages (, , , etc.) and add  to all interactive elements.
    -   Why to solve this issue: To enable robust end-to-end testing required for a production-ready application.
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend.
    -   Is recurring issue? Y.
-   **Issue 2: Hardcoded employer role in **
    -   Debug checklist:  for the phone number  in  and  to ensure this logic was fully removed in the refactor.
    -   Why to solve this issue: To ensure authentication and role logic is dynamic and database-driven, not hardcoded.
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Backend.
    -   Is recurring issue? Y.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Framer Motion (heavily used for cosmic flywheel animations), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic (for data modeling and validation), MongoDB (via  async driver).
- **Architecture:** PWA, Monorepo-like structure. Backend refactored from a monolith to a service with distinct model and route files.
- **Core Concepts:** Agentic AI, Doers Profiler (D.P.), Talent Card, DoersScore™, Talent Tracker, 5C Decision Making Framework, A2A (Agent-to-Agent) optimization, Cosmic Flywheel UX.

**key DB schema**

**changes in tech stack**
- **Backend Refactor:** Moved from a single monolithic  with mocked data to a structured application with  for schemas,  for API logic, and a real MongoDB connection.

**All files of reference**
-   : Source of truth for all database schemas.
-   : Source of truth for all backend API logic.
-   : The WOW APP entry point with the cosmic flywheel.
-   : The core Talent Card feature.
-   : The Captain Command Centre with the 5C framework.
-   : The multi-lingual family dashboard.
-   : The latest passing test report for the backend.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **Frontend Data Fetching:** All frontend components need to be refactored to fetch data from the new backend APIs instead of using hardcoded JSON objects.
-   **Monolithic Frontend Components:** Pages like  and  contain a very large amount of code and logic. They should be broken down into smaller, reusable components.

**key api endpoints**
Defined in :
-   : Create a new Doers Profiler.
-   : Get a user's Doers Profiler.
-   : Create a new Family profile.
-   : Get a Family's profile.
-   Standard CRUD endpoints for users and jobs.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **URGENT: 9 AM Deadline:** The user expects a testable build for their CTO (Vijay) and Data Scientist (Sujal) at 9 AM. The highest priority is to connect the frontend to the backend to make the application functional.
-   **You are OPTIMUS:** The user has given you the persona of Optimus, a super agent builder. You are expected to be creative, autonomous, and deliver a WOW experience. The user has given you creative freedom to build the best possible app.
-   **The Vision is Everything:** The user's instructions are dense with vision (e.g., shared foresighted future, agentic AI, World Expo 2031). Embrace this language. The technical implementation must serve this grand vision.
-   **Backend is BUILT, not INTEGRATED:** A real backend now exists and has passed unit tests. Your first job is the plumbing: connect the frontend  calls to the new FastAPI endpoints.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (updated multiple times)
-    (New, covers backend persistence)

3.  **User:** The moonshot is unreadable; revert to a simple card swipe structure. (Completed)
4.  **User:** Provides a massive, final vision for the WOW APP, giving the agent the persona of OPTIMUS and creative freedom. Asks for Junicorn Finder/Hackathon buttons.
5.  **Agent:** Commits to building the WOW APP. (In Progress)
6.  **Agent:** Rebuilds the landing page and splash screen to match the new vision. (Completed)
7.  **User:** Likes the new Real D.P. look. Instructs the agent to build all workflows and the database management source code for a 9 AM review by his CTO.
8.  **Agent:** Commits to building the full backend for the 9 AM deadline. (In Progress)
9.  **Agent:** Creates , , and tests the new backend. (Completed)
10. **User:** Asks to rearrange the entire web app into a flywheel format and makes a final request for the landing page will AI question design. (This seems to be a mix of previous requests, the agent has implemented the latest versions).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The application is functionally broken from an end-user perspective because the frontend is not connected to any backend data source.
-   **Mocked:** The frontend is visually complete but all data is static and hardcoded.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Razorpay:** Planned for payments.
-   **Twilio/Plavio:** Planned for OTP.
-   **Google DeepMind:** Explicitly requested by the user for the AI engine.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES.  was used to validate the new backend persistence layer. It created test files and passed all tests.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:**
    - 
    - Testing agent created a test file for the backend in .
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
The backend is now persistent. New users can be created via the API. The old hardcoded OTP logic may still be in place on the frontend but is irrelevant for the new backend. Testing should focus on creating and retrieving data via the new API endpoints.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has followed the user's latest (and often conflicting) instructions in rapid succession. The most significant pending item is not forgotten but is the next logical step: integrating the newly built backend with the existing frontend.
