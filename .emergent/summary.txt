<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's vision is to build a full-stack AI-native application called Right Doers World, now also referred to as TalentON.AI. Initially conceived as a global talent matching platform, the vision has expanded dramatically.

The core goal is to create a **Human Potential Management and Transformation Company (H.P.M.T.C.)** that operates a **D2D (Doer-to-Doer)** Full Flywheel ecosystem. This system aims to address career confusion and job loss fears by building talent pipelines for hyperlocal and global needs, attracting ESG funds, and demonstrating impact to governments and corporations.

A key deliverable is a high-fidelity demo for an upcoming Dubai summit, showcasing a specialized **Nuclear Engineering Talent Pipeline** for a prospective client, PowerMech, and demonstrating a state-level impact model for Karnataka, India. The application must embody the Human-AI-Robo Collaborative System and a World Wheel / Work Wheel framework for organizing talent and careers, powered by an Agentic AI system.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Personas:** Talent (Doer), Consumer, Company (PowerMech), and Government (Karnataka, Andhra, etc.). The student persona (Rohan Kumar/Aadhya Sharma) is the primary focus for the Nuclear Engineering demo.
2.  **Core Features:**
    *   **Flywheel Concept:** A self-reinforcing loop where more students attract more companies, creating more jobs and demonstrating impact that attracts government support.
    *   **Nuclear Engineering Pipeline:** A detailed, gamified onboarding flow for aspiring nuclear engineers, from self-assessment to a year-by-year curriculum and corporate matching.
    *   **Agentic AI System:** A hub of specialized AI agents (Master Orchestrator, Discovery, Learning, Matching, etc.) that manage the user journey.
    *   **World Wheel & Work Wheel:** A comprehensive UI to visualize the 12 talent clusters, 1000+ job roles, and L1-L5 career levels.
    *   **Government Dashboards:** Detailed, data-rich dashboards demonstrating talent metrics, economic impact, and program success, specifically for the Karnataka Model and its public schools program.
    *   **Corporate Dashboard:** A dashboard for partners like PowerMech showing matched talent pipelines, ROI, and competitor FOMO alerts.
    *   **Tokenomics (E-COIN):** A planned Energy/Efficiency Tokenization architecture.
    *   **Capability Clubs:** The new term for Talent Clubs.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a high-fidelity frontend prototype with a vast number of screens. Building upon the initial 26-screen MVP, the agent has added approximately 15 new pages, primarily displaying static data. These new additions include:
- A complete, multi-step **Nuclear Engineering Talent Pipeline** flow.
- A **Corporate Dashboard** designed for PowerMech.
- The **Full Flywheel** features: , , and .
- A detailed **Karnataka Model Government Dashboard** ().
- A drill-down **Karnataka Public Schools Dashboard** ().
- The  has been significantly redesigned with new branding (H.P.M.T.C., Human-AI-Robo System) and navigation links to the new features.
The backend remains a collection of mock endpoints from the previous session, with no new APIs or logic added to support the extensive new frontend.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent finished creating the  page, adding the necessary routing and a link from the , and verified its appearance with a screenshot. The user then provided new strategic documents and concepts (Capability Clubs, E-COIN). The agent was acknowledging this new input when the session ended.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: N (Verified via screenshot only, no functional testing)

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:  attributes missing.**
    -   Debug checklist: Review , identify missing test IDs in the original 26 pages, and add them using .
    -   Why to solve this issue: To achieve a 100% test pass rate and ensure the application is robustly testable for future development.
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend.
    -   Is recurring issue? N.
-   **Issue 2: PRD.md is outdated.**
    -   The agent never updated  to reflect the massive scope expansion, a task from the original handoff.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** Previous agent lost context and failed.
- **Recurrence count:** 1
- **Status:** RESOLVED (in this session). The current agent has been praised for its deep insights and ability to synthesize the user's complex vision. The new agent must maintain this high level of context awareness.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (via ). Currently all mock.
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
- **AI Integration (Planned):**  library for Google Gemini.
- **Core Concepts:** Agentic AI Workflows, Flywheel business model, hyper-personalized career pathing, data-driven dashboards.

**key DB schema**
No new database schemas have been implemented. The schema remains inferred from the previous session's mocked data.

**changes in tech stack**
-  was added to the frontend.

**All files of reference**
-   : All newly created  files listed in the architecture.
-   : Contains all new routes.
-   : Contains updated branding and navigation.
-   : Contains link to the new schools dashboard.
-   : Report containing the still-unresolved  issue.
-   All user-uploaded artifacts from this session (PDFs, DOCX, JPEGs) containing strategic direction.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **ENTIRE BACKEND:** The backend is non-existent for all new features. It's the most critical area needing development to turn the prototype into a functional application.
-   **Static Data:** All new pages are built with hardcoded static data. This needs to be replaced with data from backend API calls.
-   **Security:**  was made a public route to pass a test. This should be reverted and placed behind authentication once the auth testing flow is fixed.

**key api endpoints**
- No new API endpoints have been created. The existing mock endpoints from the previous session are still in place.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User Interaction Model:** The user provides vision through a high-volume stream of consciousness, supported by numerous documents and YouTube links. You MUST synthesize this information and get explicit screen-by-screen agreement before building. Do not rush. The user values deep reasoning.
-   **Vision over Literal Deadlines:** The user mentions hard deadlines (e.g., Dubai Summit Jan 9th), but research indicates these may be conceptual. Focus on delivering on the agreed-upon features, not the literal date.
-   **Build Frontend First, then Backend:** The established pattern is to build high-fidelity, static frontend screens to get user approval on the UX/UI, then circle back to build the backend logic.
-   **Acknowledge and Incorporate All Feedback:** The user provides constant course corrections (e.g., Capability Clubs instead of Talent Clubs). You must incorporate these changes immediately in your planning and communication.
-   **Priority is the Full Flywheel:** The core concepts are now the H.P.M.T.C. vision, the Agentic AI system, the World/Work Wheels, and the stakeholder dashboards (Corporate/Government).

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- The agent updated  but did not create any new test reports. The user uploaded numerous strategic documents throughout the session.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Msg 173):** Approves the Dubai demo readiness, confirms next steps are real data/AI integration, and uploads 5 new documents about the Karnataka Public Schools program.
2.  **Agent (Msg 174):** Commits to studying the new documents.
3.  **Agent (Msg 180-194):** Builds the , adds routing, verifies with a screenshot, and presents a summary of the new dashboard.
4.  **User (Msg 195):** Approves the new dashboard and confirms the list of upcoming tasks.
5.  **User (Msg 196):** Introduces major new strategic concepts: Capability Clubs, H.P.M.T.C., E-COIN tokenization, and a complex 48x48 persona matching matrix. Uploads 5 more documents.
6.  **Agent (Msg 197):** Acknowledges the new incredible strategic depth and commits to studying the new documents to build the cognitive system.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   Testability is compromised due to missing s.
    -   The testing process fails on authentication.
-   **Mocked:**
    -   **Everything.** The entire application is a frontend-only prototype. All backend logic, AI integration, OTP, database interactions, and dynamic data for the 15+ new screens are completely absent and hardcoded.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google Gemini:** Planned for AIMEE AI assistant and Agentic AI Hub. To be implemented using  and the **Emergent LLM Key**.
-   **Twilio (or similar):** Planned for real OTP authentication.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, but only once.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None identified, but testing was incomplete. The agent fixed one issue found by the testing agent but did not re-run the tests to confirm the fix or check for regressions. The original test failures (, auth) remain unfixed.

**Credentials to test flow:**
The application uses a mocked Phone + OTP login. Enter any phone number and any 6-digit OTP on the authentication screen. For registration tests, a new, unused phone number must be employed to avoid errors.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   **Fix  issue:** The P0 issue from the initial handoff was completely ignored.
-   **Update PRD.md:** The project documentation is now severely out of date with the massive scope creep.
-   **Fix Auth Test Failure:** The testing agent's auth issue was identified but not resolved.
-   **Re-run Full Tests:** After fixing the  issue, the agent did not re-run the frontend testing agent to validate the fix and check for regressions.</analysis>
