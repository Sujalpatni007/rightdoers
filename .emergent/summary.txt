**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui. Custom hooks (, ) for data fetching.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (via ).
- **Architecture:** PWA. Frontend is now fully integrated with the backend via a new services layer.
- **Core Concepts:** Agentic AI, DoersScore™, 5C Decision Making, Content + Campaign Growth Loop, Streak System, D-COINs.

**key DB schema**
- No changes were made to the database schema in this session. The existing schemas in  for , , and  were used.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **USER IS ON BREAK:** The user has explicitly stated they are taking a rest and will return with their CTO, Vijay. Do not proceed with the paused tasks (PDF Report, Twilio OTP) until the user gives the green light.
-   **CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION:** The immediate next step is to address the user's last question regarding the use of the free AI tool GLM 4.7 for testing and CRM. The previous agent has already done the analysis; you need to synthesize and present the final answer.
-   **VISION-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT:** The user is highly conceptual and provides direction through high-level ideas (Soonicorn, Holy Trinity) and YouTube links. Your primary job is to interpret this vision and translate it into concrete, buildable features, as the previous agent successfully did.
-   **CONFIDENCE IN CURRENT BUILD:** The user is exploring external tools. Reiterate the value of the existing integrated application as the core platform for testing and achieving their business goals, while positioning external tools as supplementary for rapid, disconnected prototyping.
