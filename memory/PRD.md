## B2D Model (Business to Doers)
The viral sharing feature enables:
1. **Students share** TalentCards → Friends see DoersScore
2. **Friends ask** "What's your DoersScore?" (like CIBIL)
3. **Network effect** → Organic growth → Next Meta/Facebook moment

---

## Backend Status
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Backend is 100% mocked. No database persistence.
